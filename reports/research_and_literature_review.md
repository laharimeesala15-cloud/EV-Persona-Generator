# Research and Literature Review

## 1. Introduction
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a key part of achieving global sustainability goals by
reducing carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. However, potential buyers
often find it hard to choose the right EV because of limited awareness, budget
differences, and varying charging infrastructure.

## 2. Problem Identification
While there are websites listing EV models, they mainly provide static data like
battery range and price. There is no intelligent system that understands a user's
personal lifestyle — such as daily distance, charging access, and city type — and
recommends EVs that truly fit those needs with easy-to-understand AI explanations.

## 3. Existing Research / Tools
- **EV Compare** – compares specifications of EVs but lacks personalization.  
- **ZigWheels EV Finder** – filters by brand or price but not lifestyle.  
- **AI Chatbots** – use general question-answering but not EV-specific recommendation.

Most systems stop at *comparison* rather than *personalization*.

## 4. Gap Identified
There is no simple, lightweight, AI-powered system that:
1. Understands a user's preferences,
2. Generates a tailored persona, and
3. Explains each EV suggestion in natural language.

## 5. Proposed Solution – EV Persona Generator
The proposed project combines data analytics and Generative AI to recommend the most
suitable EV models. The system will:
- Take user inputs: budget, daily travel, city type, charging access  
- Recommend top 3 EVs from a dataset  
- Use a Gen-AI model (OpenAI / Gemini) to generate friendly explanations for each
  recommendation ("This car suits you because...")

This helps users make informed, eco-friendly decisions.

## 6. Expected Impact
- Encourage EV adoption  
- Educate consumers through AI-driven insights  
- Support sustainability goals (reduced emissions and better energy usage)
